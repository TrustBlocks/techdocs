## Why is the Accord Project relevant for developers?

The Accord Project provides a universal format for smart legal contracts, and this format is embodied in a variety of open source projects that comprise the Accord Project technology stack. The Accord Project is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone.

The Accord Project is developing tools including a [Visual Studio Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=accordproject.cicero-vscode-extension), [React based web components](https://github.com/accordproject/web-components) and a command line interface for working with Accord Project Contracts. You can integrate contracts into existing applications, create new applications or simply assist lawyers with developing applications with the Ergo language. 

There is a welcoming community on Slack that is eager to help. [Join our Community](https://www.accordproject.org/membership/)
